Title: Summary Statistics for Histogram/Count Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michael Milton
Maintainer: Michael Milton <michael.r.milton@gmail.com>
Description: In some cases you will have data in a histogram format, where
  you have a vector of all possible observations, and a vector of how many
  times each observation appeared. You could expand this into a single 1D
  vector, but this may not be advisable if the counts are extremely large.
  'HistDat' allows for the calculation of summary statistics without the need
  for expanding your data.
